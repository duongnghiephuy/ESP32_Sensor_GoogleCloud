# ESP32_Sensor_GoogleCloud
#ESP32 sending sensor's reading (Hall sensor) to Google Cloud IoT via MQTT

The Hall sensor measures magnetic field perpendicular to its location on ESP32 board. Framwork: Arduino. The project is built in PlatformIO.

The library is based on [google-cloud-iot-arduino] (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-iot-arduino) and structured to play nicely alongside Platform IO.
